# Aim: Write a Python program to calculate sum all the items in a list. 
# i. To calculate sum all the items in a list. list1=[1,2,3,4,5] 
# Algorithm: 
# 1.Start the program. 
# 2.Create a list of numbers and store it in a variable named "numbers". 
# 3.Initialize a variable named "total" to 0, which will hold the sum of the 
# numbers. 
# 4.Iterate through each number in the list using a for loop: 
# - Inside the loop, add the current number to the "total" variable. 
# 5.After the loop, "total" will contain the sum of all the numbers in the list. 
# 6.Print the value of "total" as the sum of all the items in the list. 
# 7.End the program
# Source code: 

List1=[1,2,3,4,5] 
Sum=0 
for x in list1:
sum+=x 
print('Displaying List',list1) 
print('Sum of all items in the list',sum) 

# Output: 
# Displaying List [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
# Sum of all items in the list 15 
# RESULT: To calculate sum all the items in a list executed successfully
