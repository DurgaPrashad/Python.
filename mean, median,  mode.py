# AIM: Write a program to compute summary statistics such as mean, median, 
# mode, standard deviation and variance of the given different types of data.
# Algorithm: 
# Import the necessary libraries: 
# import numpy as np from 
# scipy import stats 
# compute the mean: 
# mean = np.mean(data) 
# print("Mean:", mean) 
# compute the median: 
# median = np.median(data) 
# print("Median:", median) 
# compute the mode: 
# mode = stats.mode(data) 
# print("Mode:", mode.mode) compute the standard diviation: std_dev = 
# np.std(data) 
# print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev) 
# Source code: 

import numpy as np 
array = np.arange(10) 
print(array) 

# Output: 
# # [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] 
# # mean
