# AIM: Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that 
# input back in upper and lower case 
# Algorithm: 
# Step 1: Prompt the user to enter a string. 
# Step 2: Read the input from the user and store it in a variable. 
# Step 3: Use the upper() method to convert the string to uppercase and store it in 
# an uppercase variable. 
# Step 4: Use the lower() method to convert the string to lowercase and store it in 
# a lowercase variable. 
# Step 5: Display the input string, the uppercase version, and the lowercase 
# version to the user.
# Source code: 

str=input('Enter a string: ') 
print('Lower Case: ',str.lower()) 
print('Upper Case: ',str.upper()) 

# Output: 
# Enter a string: Apple is a Fruit 
# Lower Case: apple is a fruit 
# Upper Case: APPLE IS A FRUIT 
# RESULT: Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input 
# back in upper and lower cases Executed successfully
