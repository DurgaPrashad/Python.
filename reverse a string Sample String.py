# AIM: Write a Python program to reverse a string Sample String : “1234abcd” 
# Expected Output : “dcba4321 
# Sample String : "1234abcd" 
# Expected Output : "dcba4321" 
# Algorithm:
# Step 1: Prompt the user to enter a string. 
# Step 2: Initialize an empty string to store the reversed string. 
# Step 3: Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string starting from 
# the last character. 
# - Within the loop, append each character to the reversed string. 
# Step 4: Display the reversed string. 
# Source code: 

str=input('Enter a string: ') 
print(str[::-1]) 

# Output: 
# Enter a string: 1234abcd 
# dcba4321 
# RESULT: Python program to reverse a string Sample String : “1234abcd” 
# Expected Output : “dcba4321” Executed successfully.
